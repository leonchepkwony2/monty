C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO



## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables


## Files
The following files are available for this project:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Task 0` | Implement the push and pall opcodes.|
| `Task 1` | Implement the pint opcode.|
| `Task 2` |Implement the pop opcode. |
| `Task 3` |Implement the swap opcode. |
| `Task 4` |Implement the add opcode. |
| `Task 5` |Implement the nop opcode. |
